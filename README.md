## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the script examples (`basic1.js`, `celsius_to_fahrenheit.js`), you will
node with npm installed on your machine (visit https://nodejs.org to install
node with npm), as well as the cloned parent project
[leaf-detective](https://github.com/umcconnell/leaf-detective).

### Initial setup

Assuming you have cloned the parent project, you can initialize the git
submodule from the parent project:

```bash
git submodule init
git config submodule.recurse true
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now, you can run the examples using node!
